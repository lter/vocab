Conversation with Duane Costa

1) Task Replace Metacat Hierarchy with Controlled vocabulary group
 - Issue - only 2 levels displayed
 - would be good to list number of datasets associated with term
 - * VOCAB would need to specify terms to be used
 - From Duane: web page is generated from XML file - relatively simple with browsegroup & terms
 - LTER SITE list is "special" and VOCAB doesn't need to mess with that....

2) Autocomplete - replace existing list?
- simple list
- use preferred term list instead
- needs to be coupled to search upgrade to allow synonyms
- SIMPLE search uses autocomplete, but not advanced search page
- * VOCAB needs to provide list of preferred terms

*3) Searching
- simple (on first page) vs advanced
  - **simple: automatically use UseFor and Narrower (possibly narrow+related)
  - advanced: in subject field use checkboxes to select narrower, or related or both or all
  - what EML parts are searched already varies between simple and advanced
- should include synonyms
- check boxes for narrower (default checked) and related (default not checked)
- scope of thesauri could also be selectable

*4) Keywording via automation
- Need to use current vocabularly in HIVE tool (may be hard to do for site-specific)
-- **easy if uses SKOS - may take some tweaking
-- would be good to automate update
-- with web services  - need documentation on how to pass text to scan to 
=======  Vocab group? ===========
- develop a PHP or web form that 
- process EML document or text using HIVE web services to generate list of possible words - with checkboxes
- return URL to  EML document with additions OR EML stub with Keyword section

5) Keywording via Browse
- browse through hierarchy and select keywords with checkboxes

Next Steps:
-Can put task in https://trac.lternet.edu/trac/NIS with use cases as separate tickets
-start with legacy first (before PASTA component)
-VOCAB needs to flesh out possible changes - write up draft tickets to
 https://trac.lternet.edu/trac/NIS/query

* are low hanging fruit or particularly valuable
