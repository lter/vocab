Conversation with Duane Costa

1) Task Replace Metacat Hierarchy with Controlled vocabulary group
 - Issue - only 2 levels displayed
 - would be good to list number of datasets associated with term

2) Autocomplete - replace existing list?
- simple list
- needs to be coupled to search upgrade to allow synonyms

*3) Searching
- should include synonyms
- check boxes for narrower (default checked) and related (default not checked)
- scope of thesauri could also be selectable

*4) Keywording via automation
- Need to use current vocabularly in HIVE tool (may be hard to do for site-specific)
-- easy if uses SKOS
- come back with check boxes for words you want to accept

5) Keywording via Browse
- browse through hierarchy and select keywords with checkboxes

Next Steps:
-Can put task in https://trac.lternet.edu/trac/NIS with use cases as separate tickets
-start with legacy first (before PASTA component)
-VOCAB needs to flesh out possible changes - write up draft tickets
* are low hanging fruit or particularly valuable
